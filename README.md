# GreenHouse_2.0

This is a new approach to controlling my little greenhouse, moving away from the Atmega 328 and opting to use a ESP32. This version will implement the same feature as the previous version adding Bluetooth BLE to monitor sensor readings remotely, new safety features including a low water interupt, and a water base heating system.
